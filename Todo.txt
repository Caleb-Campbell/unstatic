UP NEXT:
- When the user signs in, they are taken back to the home page, and when you navigate to /dashboard, it has a hard time getting the userId from the current session. This might be how it's called back, but I've had to manually insert my user Id for testing purposes.

ISSUES:
- Change ids in folder and project tables to strings. This looks much better thaan having a number as an id, and prevents users from finding projects they shouldn't. This means we will need to modify how they are used in the dashboard as well
